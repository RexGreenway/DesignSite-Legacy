Rex Greenway Website Code
=========================

Back up for my (in progress) website source code. Practically finished just also need to finish the Websites content.

This project was my first ever Comp-Sci project.

It introduced me to HTML5, CSS3, and the begginnnings of programming in the form of JavaScript. Started in fustration of online web building tools not doing exactly as I wanted I developed this site to show off my personal art and design work.

All Gallery images included are examples of my own work and were placeholders for testing purposes.
